    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Fathima Suhana, an aspiring software engineer passionate about
      creating meaningful and impactful digital experiences. I have a strong
      interest in web development, user interface design, and problem-solving.
      I'm currently exploring new technologies and building my skills through
      hands-on projects and continuous learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy working on both the front-end and back-end of applications, and
      I'm always excited to learn new tools and frameworks. Outside of tech, I
      love reading, exploring ideas, and collaborating with others to bring
      projects to life.
    </p>
